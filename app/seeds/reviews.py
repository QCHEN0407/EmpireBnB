The neighborhood is very conveniently located and although it’s a lively neighborhood the apartment is very quiet! Would absolutely recommend to stay there!"

To be honest I️ rarely used public transportation because it was always convenient to just walk but when I️ needed to it was right there."

You could tell that the host made sure that the apartment is very clean. Furthermore, they clearly explained the area, and also arranged a taxi for me from the apartment to the airport after I checked out. For this price, I honestly think this is a bargain. I am looking forward to staying here again one day."

The place was very clean, modern, had everything we needed to feel at home, and was an easy walk to all the sites we wanted to see. Also close to a big supermarket which was handy, and few steps to dozens of restaurants and cafes. Communication was great too. We would highly recommend this wonderful apartment."

The apartment was walking distance to some tourist attractions, and it was close to many metros to get you to the ones further away. This is definitely the perfect place to stay in NYC."
